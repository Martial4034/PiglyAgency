## Jeux Roulette

From the perspective of a customer dining in the restaurant:

- A customer eats in a restaurant
- They scan a QR Code
- They leave a review on the Google My Business listing of the restaurant
- They win a gift (probability/validity/conditions chosen by the restaurateur)
- They receive a QR Code link via SMS

The restaurant gains reviews, thus visibility, but also brings back its customers through the gifts it distributes. Finally, it can have data on the profitability of the campaign through its access to its Admin Panel.
